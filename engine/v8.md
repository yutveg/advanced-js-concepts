### How the V8 engine works:

1.) Parses the code into an abstract syntax tree
2.) AST goes through interpreter
3.a) (Ignition) Interpreter runs through AST line-by-line spits out Bytecode
3.b) Profiler monitors and watches code as it runs, and notes how it can be optimized.
4.) If code can be optimized, Profiler passes the code to the JIT (Turbo-Fan) compiler and returns the optimized machine code in place of slower Bytecode

### Pros And Cons With Interpreters/Compiler

=================================================
Pro: Interpreters are quick to get up and running. Because: No language conversion needed. Simply interprets and runs commands.

Con: When running same code more than once, can become quite slow. Compiler deals with loops by simplifying code, doesn't call function multiple times, optimizing.

### Notes on Turbo Fan Compiler

- Can try to optimize code, realize it is making a mistake, and deoptimize code which is slower

### Call Stack (usually stores simple vars, functs)

- first in last out mode
- stores function and variables as code executes
- run and keep track of location in program with stack frames

### Memory Heap (complex data structures, objects)

- large region in memory that JS engine provides for us, to store any type of arbitrary data in unordered fashion
- place to store and write information ( data )

### Garbage Collection

- javascript is a garbage collected language
- when allocates memory, will auto-clean memory when no longer in use
- "false impression to ignore memory management"
- Utilizes "Mark And Sweep" algorithm
- sweeps what is not currently being referenced/pointed at
-

### Memory Leaks

- allocating too much space via excessive/infinite loop
- global variables are a risk as well
- event listeners common way to memory leak, when not removed they accumulate
